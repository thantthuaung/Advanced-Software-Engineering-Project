# JCU Gym Management System

This project is a web application prototype for managing gym membership, booking, and administration at James Cook University (JCU) Singapore campus.

## Project Overview

The system supports two main user roles:

- **Gym Users** (students and staff):  
  - Register online securely  
  - Book gym sessions in advance  
  - View and manage bookings  
  - Optional virtual gym tour and AI workout trainer  

- **Administrators**:  
  - Manage user registrations  
  - Track gym usage and booking statistics
