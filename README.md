# Advanced-Software-Engineering-Project
# JCU Gym Management System

This project is a web application prototype for managing gym membership, booking, and administration at James Cook University (JCU) Singapore campus.

## Project Overview

The system supports two main user roles:

- **Gym Users** (students and staff):  
  - Register online securely  
  - Book gym sessions in advance  
  - View and manage bookings  
  - Optional virtual gym tour and AI workout trainer  

- **Administrators**:  
  - Manage user registrations  
  - Track gym usage and booking statistics  

## Initial Backlog Ideas

| Session booking                  | High     |
| Manage bookings                  | Medium   |
| Admin user management            | High     |
| Booking statistics               | Medium   |
| Virtual gym tour                 | Low      |
| AI workout trainer              | Low      |
| Session reminders               | Medium   |
